    <p class="antialiased">My name is Dylan Jean Husted. I was born on 18 December 1992. I was born and raised in the
      lovely Somerset West,
      Cape Town, South Africa. I matriculated from Parel Vallei High School. I studied BSc in Mathematics and Computer
      Science at the University of Cape Town.</p>
    <p class="antialiased">I love animals of all kinds, but especially cats. My cat's name is Long Socks in the Back,
      Short Socks in the Front (Socks for short). I am a huge Liverpool FC fan and have been since I was a child playing
      soccer. I have always been interested in technology and find most science related topics fascinating. I love
      thinking about
      problems, coming up with solutions and solving puzzles. I love learning new things.</p>
    <p class="antialiased">I am pretty laid back and do not get offended easily. I always try to keep a jovial attitude
      and make people laugh, but I am a pretty serious person when I have a solid goal. I like helping people and
      generally tend to put
      others ahead of my own desires.</p>
