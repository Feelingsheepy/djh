    <p class="antialiased">I have always been a fan of playing games of all kinds. This includes console, computer
      games, board games, card games and sport. Pretty much anything where you can compete with other people or test
      your mind.</p>
    <p class="antialiased">I love reading books. I generally read fantasy, philosophy, sci-fi or history books. I love
      getting swept away to another world or another time and getting engrossed there. I have also done a little bit of
      my own writing, but I am too shy to share that.</p>
    <p class="antialiased">I have pretty much always listened to music while I am doing other things or even just as its
      own activity. For example when I used to take the bus to varsity, when I am playing a game that doesn't require
      sound and when I am coding.</p>
