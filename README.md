Just a small About Me website.

Created using Vue, Nuxt, NuxtUI v3, Tailwind v4.

Hosted on Azure Static Web Apps at: https://polite-coast-0c0658603.4.azurestaticapps.net/

I know there are no scrollbars, they were so ugly I had to remove them and I haven't had time to style them.

I need redo the Music section of About me page, because I couldn't figure out how to fill the space on the left. It looks fine for mobile.

The Philosophy section of the About Me page needs to be slightly adjusted so the images are not so large, but I want to maintain the look of a book for each slide.

The Books section of the About Me page needs to allow for clicking on the greyed out images to scroll the carousel.

Feel free to make suggestions or provide feedback.
